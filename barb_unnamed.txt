# Path of Legends
Filled with wrath and despair he mounted upon Rochallor his great horse and rode forth alone, and none might restrain him. He Passed over Dor-Nu-Fauglith like a wind amid the dust, and all that beheld his onset fled in amaze , thinking that Oromë himself was come: for a great madness of rage was upon him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar. Thus he came alone to Angband's gates, and he sounded his horn, and smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth in single combat. And Morgoth Came.

When interacting with a creature that you Are fighting, regularly trained with, or have fought with no longer than a day ago, you have a sense for what they are thinking. To hide their intent from your insight, they must make a Deception(charisma) check against...

### Damage balance notes and stuff for cool people who read those
#### dmg per dice based on dice science and stuff
| how to roll | `dmg funk |` d4| d6 |d8 | d10 | d12 |
| :----:|:-------------|:----|:----|:---|:---|:---|
|roll|`f(n) = (n + 1)/2|`2.5|3.5|4.5|5.5|6.5|
|reroll|`f(n) = n/2 + 1.5 + 2/n|` 3.0|4.16|5.25|6.3|7.33|
|exploding|`f(n) = n/2 + 1 + 2/n|`3.5|4.33|5.25|6.2|7.16|
|both|`f(n) = n/2 + 2 - 3/(2*n)|`3.62|4.75|5.81|6.85|7.87|
</div>
##### how did you even get those numbers?
Shhhh, remember this is a barbarian subclass. I
##### What that Greataxe do tho?
your average damage at level 14 Barbarian who has ascended beyond Barbarian. would Deal 1d12 + 1d10 + 5 on a hit while raging for an adjusted average of... 19.73. A number that you could compare to the that an average barbarian would deal 16.5

#####  DPR tho?
compare the damage between us and a zealot hitting twice. which would be a zealot dealing...

16.5 * 2 + 3.5 + 7 = 43.5 damage

and us having ...

2 * 19.73 = 39.56 damage
##### What About Accuracy?
well, let's copy Treantmonks homework and assume accuracy of %65
##### To Hit Armor Class Whatever
| base |regular advantage|extra advantage|
|:--:|:---:|:---:|
|%65|%87.75|%95.71|
which should really save you from Accepting disadvantage from reckless attack and then still missing, because that sucks.
##### thats not really the whole DPR math 
But none of those actually take into account the good stuff of the class. your crit chance with using reckless attack is %27.1 vs %9.75 of a regular barbarian and your critical damage is going to benefit from 2 of your improved d8's for your rage damage. More frequent critical strikes improve your chances of getting a bonus attack from the Great Weapon Master Feat that a few barbarians take.

##### I Still need more math
Also using your level 10 feature you can attack on your turn using your reaction which benefits from reckless attack because it is on your turn. which is just some rules voodoo that no one else gets.

##### Why can't you just run the calc for me?
that's an opportunity for you to do your own googling and that's an important skill for you to practice.
##### But If this is so good how can I convince my DM too use this?
Maybe don't show 'em this page and just let them do their own math. They don't need to know your at almost %100 more attacks, %10 more accurate when reckless,  %300 higher Critical strike chance, and throwing like 10 dice around every time you roll damage. It can be our little secret ;-)
##### So Whats the actual DPR increase You can Promise?
You'll Probably be averaging  around 1.25 Toguros. Still B class Demon but hey that's Pretty Solid.

##### If You do all this math you must clearly be a cool intellegent and attractive person who is also a great Dungeon Master.
You can reach me @direpeacock  on most things. 
##### Mission Accomplished
So This Class is supposed to improve your attacks from all of those angles which compound on eachother to increase your DPR, Doing what Barbarians are supposed to do. Rise up and seize the means of rolling many many dice from the WoTC game design team.
